# Module 1 Challenge: Refactoring Starter Code

## What:
- Created a web application from scratch. The web app is a portfolio page with links to contact mediums and created projects. The portfolio is intended to be built upon over time. 

## User Story / Acceptance Criteria:
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport



## Major Modifications:
- created a header including my name, profile photo, and a nav bar
- made boxes to house intro, contacts, and projects
- made adjustments so that the most recent project displays to the left bigger than the rest
- when web page is smaller than 768px, some elements appear in a column
